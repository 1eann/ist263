<h1> LeAnn Nguyen's Biography </h1>
<p>
    I'm a full time college student here at Syracuse University. I'm 19 years old, born on June 16, 2005 meaning I'm a sophomore this year. I enjoy listening to music and dancing on my free time. I also love being around friends and I have a habit of talking a lot. I'm majoring in Applied Data Analytics but I don't really like my major but I'm kind of just sticking to it for job security.
    </p>
<p>
    I have a family of 5, my dad, my mom, a sister, and a brother. I'm the middle child. Fun fact, actually scary fact, I have 9 toes because my left toe had 6 toes when I was born but the doctor amputated 2 toes by accident so I only have 4 toes on my left foot meaning I only have a total of 9 toes.

<p>
    When it comes to jobs I've only worked in food services and I absolutely hate it. I was also a teacher one point in my life and I didn't really like it because a good chunk of the elementary students were taller than me.
