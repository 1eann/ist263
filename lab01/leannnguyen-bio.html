        Hi, my name is LeAnn Nguyen. I’m currently a sophomore at the iSchool majoring in Applied Data Analytics. I don’t really have interests within my major … I’m kind of just doing it to do it which is why I picked to take this class because it seemed pretty fun. Nevertheless, I’m curious where this path will take me. I enjoy dancing outside of school, I’m on a dance team here at SU. I’m from New York City so I don’t know how to drive and I don’t really have the excitement or urge to learn how to drive. I also like to listen to music, read manga, and watch anime. Something interesting about me is that I have 4 toes on my left foot because I was born with 6 but the doctor accidentally amputated 2, therefore I only have 9 toes.
